The purpose of this program is to simulate a customer buying chickens at a virtual chicken store, while evaluating their egg-laying potential.
The project demonstrates an understanding of method calls, loops, if statements and input validation in Java.

Key elements of the design include: 

- Method Calls: Each process is separated into static methods with specific parameters.

- Scanner Class: Used to collect user input for certain choices.

- If Statements: Handle condition-based logic for value calculation.

- Loops: A while loop keeps prompting the user to buy chickens until they respond “no.”
